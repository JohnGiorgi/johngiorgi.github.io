‚Ü™ _Generate, don‚Äôt discriminate! Modelling biomedical information extraction tasks with sequence-to-sequence learning_. Invited talk at the [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence group at AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/r-d/data-science-and-ai.html) (August 2022). I spoke about [our recent work](https://aclanthology.org/2022.bionlp-1.2/) on using sequence-to-sequence models for end-to-end biomedical information extraction tasks.
