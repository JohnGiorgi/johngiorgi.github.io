‚Ü™ __Clinical Note Generation from Doctor-Patient Conversations using Large Language Models__. Gave a talk on our winning submission to the MEDIQA-Chat 2023 shared tasks at the ClincalNLP workshop. [üé• [video](https://aclanthology.org/2023.clinicalnlp-1.36.mp4) | üõù [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ucJxBE9LkOSnTi1SFXUG1z4jgQNqmYAhjRH_fWoVnMI/edit?usp=sharing)]

‚Ü™ __Generate, don't discriminate! Modelling biomedical information extraction tasks with sequence-to-sequence learning__. Invited talk at the [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence group at AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/r-d/data-science-and-ai.html) (August 2022). I spoke about [our recent work](https://aclanthology.org/2022.bionlp-1.2/) on using sequence-to-sequence models for end-to-end biomedical information extraction tasks [üõù [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eODyc1zvqGwP0iiwVeszII0kskGklxZsA_ogekRYabY/edit?usp=sharing)]

‚Ü™ __Natural Language Processing and Transformers__. I created and delivered a tutorial for the University of Toronto's [CSC413 Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://uoft-csc413.github.io/2023/) class (Winter 2022 & 2023). This tutorial focused on helping students build intuition about the [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), and specifically the self-attention mechanism [üõù [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GlOEERsbu71LhpT1L-nMcDtOAwgg8DPScbNkjF989zc/edit?usp=sharing)]
