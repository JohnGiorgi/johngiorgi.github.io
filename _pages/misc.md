## Projects

### SciTagger

A simple experiment in using __few-shot in-context learning__ with __large language models__ to perform scientific discourse tagging. Based on [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) and works with both [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs) and [OpenAI APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). Checkout the streamlit demo here: [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/johngiorgi/SciTagger/main/app.py)
