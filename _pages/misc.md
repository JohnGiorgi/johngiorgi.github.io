## Projects

### SciTagger

A simple experiment in using __few-shot in-context learning__ with __large language models__ to perform scientific discourse tagging. Based on [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) and works with both [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs) and [OpenAI APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). Checkout the streamlit demo here: [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/johngiorgi/SciTagger/main/app.py)

### CiteNet

I built a search and visualization tool for scientific literature with a fellow lab mate. We wrote a preprint describing the system [here](./../files/citenet.pdf). Unfortunately, the tool is no longer supported, but it was highly similar to the now popular [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)! Check out some media coverage about the project [here](https://vectorinstitute.ai/vector-researchers-release-scientific-paper-search-tool-to-help-in-fight-against-covid-19/), [here](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/using-ai-u-t-researchers-develop-smart-search-tool-help-navigate-flood-covid-19-work) and [here](https://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/news/donnelly-centre-graduate-students-develop-smart-search-app-covid-19-literature).
