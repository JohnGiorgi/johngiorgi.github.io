I am a 4th-year __computer science Ph.D. student__ at the University of Toronto and a graduate student researcher at the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](https://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I previously interned at [Ai2](https://ai2-web.apps.allenai.org/) (on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/about) team) and at [Semantic Health](https://www.semantichealth.ai/). My work centres on __natural language processing (NLP)__ and __natural language understanding (NLU)__ of scientific text, particularly biomedical literature, but I am broadly interested in all things ML/AI/NLP. I completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Ottawa, graduating with a B.Sc in biochemistry. I completed an M.Sc. in computer science at the University of Toronto. When I am not 💻 I like to 🚵‍♂️, 🏂 and 🏋️‍♂️.
